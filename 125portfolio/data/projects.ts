    title: 'UCLA Esports',
    description: "As a volunteer at UCLAE, I learned and developed my graphic design skills under their unique visual identity.",
    fullDescription: `Working with UCLA Esports was one of my first forays into 'proper' graphic design. I was a strong illustrator but not practiced with graphics. I was able to apply my compositional skills from illustration while learning a new skill, which was challenging, but quickly rewarding. Within my first year, I was able to work closely with the rest of the design team, along with marketing and social media to produce a variety of assets of my own design while sticking closely to the defined style guide. These included birthday posts, score templates, fundraiser announcements, printed event assets, and senior banquet cards.`,

    title: 'LPC KDC',
    description: "During my year at LPC, I took over the role of lead publicist for the school's K-Pop Dance Club, establishing their branding and increasing their marketing presence.",
    fullDescription: `The reflected logo plays on the symmetry of the letters in the KDC acronym, which creates repeating shapes in the negative space. The logo is simple with space for one accent color for versatility. It was intended to be rotated out every year or semester to indicate different 'eras.'  The inital branding was inspired by the recent hit, 'QUEENCARD' by girl-group G-IDLE, so a bold pink took center stage as the main accent color. A variety of stars (an extremely popular detail in a variety of k-pop designs) serve as the main repeating decorative elements â€” expanding on the four-pointed star formed by the logo.`,
